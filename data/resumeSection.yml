  ## My Qualification


  My interest in law began during my university studies, where I acquired my initial experience as a part-time paralegal. 
  Although my primary focus throughout my professional life has been on property law, I have also taken an interest in the tax field. 
  
  
  I am a licensed Thai lawyer and hold certification as a barrister, which is required to represent clients in court trials. 
  In addition, I am also a public notary with extensive experience and knowledge in areas such as property purchases, estate administration, company establishment, and family law.
