  ## My Qualification


  My interest in law began during my university studies, where I acquired my initial experience as a part-time paralegal. 
  Although my primary focus throughout my professional life has been on property law, I have also taken an interest in the tax field. 
  
  
  I am a licensed Thai lawyer and hold certification as an attorney, which is required to represent clients in court trials. 
  In addition, I am also a public notary with extensive experience and knowledge in areas such as property purchases, estate administration, company establishment, and family law.

      ### Absolute Lawyer Hua Hin Limited

      In my law office I face difficulties arising out during the legal process which mostly and immediately pop-up in the last minute before closing i.e. changing the term of payment, problem of transfer money from abroad, failure to furnish necessary documents required by the land office, invalid of Land Office Power of Attorney, expiration of passport, dispute of income tax of landlord/developer, even an incorrect of company minute of meeting etc.
