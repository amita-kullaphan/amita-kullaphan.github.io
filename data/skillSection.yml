  ## Why hire me?

   Despite my sunny character and easy-going nature, I approach the issues that clients bring to me with seriousness.


   I understand the fear and uncertainty that expatriates experience when making large transfers to purchase new homes, as I am well aware that things do not always go smoothly in Thailand.
   Rather than telling clients what they want to hear, I offer solutions based on facts and honesty because I care about their situation and future.


   On the other hand, dealing with the inheritance procedures of a loved one who has passed away can be emotional. 
   I realize the seriousness of the situation and compassionately guide clients through difficult times.
