  ## About me

  In Thailand, nicknames are typically used instead of birth names. My nickname is Kiki.

  I have a great love for exploring local cuisines and traveling. 
  
  
  My initial trips were during my academic years to South Korea and Taiwan, where I traveled to work on tax report projects with my classmates. 
  As I progressed in my career, I was fortunate enough to travel to Europe and other parts of East Asia. 
  
  
  In addition to diverse cuisines, I also came across distinct cultures that taught me the importance of embracing differences. 
  Since most of my clients are Westerners, I understand their preference for direct and detailed communication.
